"""Packed WAD data in flat byte arrays for 8-bit processor simulation.

Four arrays:
  rom_main    - vertices, BSP nodes, subsectors, seg headers, VWH heights,
                linedef back-face data, sin/cos, reciprocals (ROM bank 1)
  rom_detail  - seg detail: VWH indices for front/back (ROM bank 2)
  ram         - vertex cache, VWH cache, packed valid bitmaps (RAM)

Seg data is split: the header (SEG_HDR_SIZE, accessed for every traversed
seg) is in rom_main; the detail (SEG_DTL_SIZE, accessed only for
front-facing segs) is in rom_detail.  This keeps each ROM region under 16KB.

All multi-byte values are little-endian (6502 native).
Most struct sizes are powers of two for fast index->offset shifts. The seg
header is NOT: it is 14 bytes, walked by a cursor (never indexed), so its
slot->offset mapping goes through seg_hdr_off().
