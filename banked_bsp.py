"""Verify the BANKED renderer (ROM_MAIN in sideways bank L0, clipper+rasteriser
in bank C) produces a bit-identical framebuffer to the flat BspRender6502, using
the banked_mem.py $FE30 model.

Strategy: build a flat BspRender6502 (loads all tables + code at flat addrs),
copy its 64K into a BankedMemory, then patch the banked deltas:
  - ROM_MAIN (verts/nodes/ss/seg_hdr) -> bank L0 @ $8000; ZP ptrs -> $8000+off
  - clipper (span_clip_bankc.bin) + rasteriser -> bank C @ $8000/$A800
  - sqr tables -> low RAM $1C00 (banked clipper/bsp umul8 read them there)
  - bsp_render code -> the *_bk.bin variants (PAGE inserts + $80xx clip entries)
Everything else (recip/bbox/angle subsystem/vxcache) stays flat (above the
$8000-$BFFF window) — reachable in the model; real-HW relocation is a later step.
