"""Player-movement collision map — DOOM P_TryMove/P_UseLines replica.

Pack-time generator + the canonical python movement model. The 6502
implementation (src/bsp/pmove.s + the driver) and every python mirror
consume THIS module, so there is exactly one statement of the rules:

  - blocking: player is a radius-16 box; one-sided lines and
    ML_BLOCKING two-sided lines stop the box (P_BlockLinesIterator ->
    P_BoxOnLineSide, restricted to lines a box can ever reach — the
    reachability-pruned, colinear-merged COLSEG set below)
  - step/opening: crossing into a sector whose floor is >24 above the
    player's current floor is blocked; door sectors use the LIVE mover
    ceiling (opening < 56 blocks) — DOOM's P_CheckPosition opening
    rules, evaluated at the destination sector (found by BSP descent)
  - z: viewz = sector floor + 41 (prescaled: the SS_VZ table), snapped
    (no bob — Eben's "no jogging"); on a moving lift floor the live
    mover height substitutes
  - use (SPACE): a 64-unit trace along the view direction against the
    USE line set: DR doors toggle (open/close/reverse), the S1 exit
    switch respawns; walkover lines (the WR lift, the W1 floor) fire on
    a committed move crossing them

Movers idle at their rest pose until triggered (the anim CFG wait
sentinel 0 = hold forever; see anim_sectors).

Table homes (bank WALK):
  COLSEG   $B8C0 / $7600   n*8: x1,y1,dx,dy (center-relative raw s16 LE)
  COLIDX   $B4A4 / +blob   36 * (u16 list offset, u8 count)
  COLLIST  follows COLIDX  u8 seg indices per 128-unit column

# units), positions are 24-bit 8.8 prescaled center-relative (the DV_PX
# format). The scale is chosen because DOOM_fixed/2048 == our 8.8:
# DOOM's forwardmove*2048 thrust IS the literal 25 below.
#
# Per DOOM tic (35Hz; P_PlayerThink + P_XYMovement order):
#   1. thrust: mom += 25 * (cos,sin)(view), sign-magnitude (25*mag5)>>5
#      (back = negated; both keys cancel exactly)
#   2. clamp each axis to +/-960 (MAXMOVE 30 world units)
#   3. displacement += mom   (position applied per FRAME, batched)
#   4. friction: if no input and both |mom| < 2 (STOPSPEED): mom = 0
#      else mom = (mom*232)>>8 FLOOR (DOOM FixedMul 0xE800 semantics:
#      arithmetic shift, so -1 decays only via the stop rule — as DOOM)
# Tic clock: PAL fields * 7/10 accumulated (50Hz * 0.7 = 35Hz), fields
# capped at 32/frame (hiccup clamp).
#
# Frame displacement applies in <=22.6-world-unit chunks (DOOM's MAXMOVE/2
# halving, extended: halve until each axis chunk <= 724), each chunk via
# try_move. A blocked chunk with a wall angle projects BOTH the leftover
# displacement AND the momentum onto the wall (P_HitSlideLine as a true
# dot-product projection on the mag5 grid: p = (d.w>>5 terms summed),
# slide = (p*wmag)>>5 per axis — DOOM's aprox-dist*cos(delta) is an

    displacement is a constant-speed step along the view ray scaled by
    the field count, so releasing a key stops dead and there is no
    coasting, no friction drift and no per-axis momentum to project.
    Collision and wall sliding are unchanged.

    d_fwd (the bca forward-coherence D-class gate) is 1 when every chunk
    committed clean AND the intended move points forward along the view
    unit (the dominant component's sign matches the unit's).  Sliding
    CLEARS it, which is the point: once the wall has deflected the move
    it is no longer a forward walk and the bbox cache's coherence
    assumption does not hold.  (The old cross==0 exactness test died

    construction and its >>8 residue is <= 0.37 deg, inside dbox_check's
