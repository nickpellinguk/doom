"""bakedscan -- find BAKED ADDRESSES: storage written as a literal.

    python3 tools/bakedscan.py              census by class
    python3 tools/bakedscan.py --list WORK  every site in one class
    python3 tools/bakedscan.py --overlaps   equates that share bytes
    python3 tools/bakedscan.py --gate       exit 1 if the count rose

WHY THIS EXISTS.  A baked address is a COPY OF A FACT.  When the real
thing moves the copy does not, and nothing tells you: it is not a build
error, it is a silent read or write of whatever lives there now.  The
map's whole scar list is this one shape -- psi planes landing on anim
tables, zp_ft at $E4F8 landing on OS ROM, PMOVE probed into a hole the
harness happened not to touch, a cfg region whose declared size was a
lie because a Python seeder owned the next address.

The fix is always the same: declare the storage in a segment and let
ld65 place it, then reference it by LABEL.

CLASSES.  Not every literal is equally bad, so they are separated:
  ZP        zero page. The hand-allocated ABI; a literal here is the
            allocation itself, and ca65 cannot beat it for addressing
            mode.  Reported but not counted against the gate.
  ABI       abi.inc / layout.inc -- the cross-language contract that
            Python seeders and tools read.  These are baked BY DESIGN,
            but they are also the ones the linker cannot police, so
            they are counted separately and should shrink over time.
  WORK      scratch/workspace variables in the writable arena.  THE
            strip target: these have no reason to be literals at all.
  TABLE     table/plane homes above the arena, including per-build
            .if BANKED splits.
  HIGH      $C000+ -- flat-build-only homes.
  PYSEED    a literal INDEX into mpu.memory in a Python harness.  Same
            copy-of-a-fact, and worse in one way: the engine's literals
            at least sit next to the code that owns them, while a
            harness literal is a private duplicate of the ABI in another
            language.  On 2026-08-31 trace_compare's mem[0] -- the view
            block's player x since forever -- started spraying the s16
            clipper's LC_OY1_LO anchor the moment zp_br_px rotated out
            of zero page, and every full-frame render still passed.
