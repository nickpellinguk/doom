"""Do the billboards actually get drawn?

THE HOLE THIS CLOSES: on 2026-08-31 a routine landed in the middle of the
object builder's fall-through, so every object overwrote its own y ladder and
returned early -- billboards stopped drawing ALTOGETHER -- and the whole
suite stayed green.  The pixel comparisons do not cover billboards, so
nothing else in the gate can see this class of failure.

Count the art stamps over the render corpus and check the total and the
per-template split.

# (POTION 9 -> 7, 2026-09-01: the armour-room strip removed the only two
#  zigzag-room potions the corpus ever had in view; the room's helmets
#  never stamped from the corpus positions, so HELMET holds at 23.)
# (HELMET 23 -> 25, 2026-09-04: the near-child bbox test was dropped from
#  the walk -- DOOM's shape, see bsp/walk.s -- so the traversal now enters
#  subsectors it used to cull, and two more helmet billboards get STAMPED.
#  They draw nothing: the framebuffer is byte-identical at all 29
#  fingerprint poses and the slot-coverage guard below still passes, so
#  this is stamping work the fully-occluded early-out discards, not new
#  geometry.  A DROP below these numbers is still a lost draw.)
