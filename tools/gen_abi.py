"""Generate the cross-language ABI constant files from ONE table.

Every address that crosses a language boundary (ca65 engine <-> ca65 boot
stubs <-> Python harness/builders) lives HERE and nowhere else. Private
copies of these addresses have shipped three broken-disc bugs (vrcache_ab,
the HUD var block, the test-harness pokes) — see project_bank_reshuffle.

Outputs (all checked in; regenerate after editing the table):
  src/abi.inc    ca65   (.if ::BANKED variants where flat differs)
  abi.py         Python  (NAME = banked value; NAME_FLAT where it differs)

The beebasm projection (abi_beeb.inc) went with beebasm on 2026-09-05 —
the boot stubs are ca65 sources and .include src/abi.inc directly.
