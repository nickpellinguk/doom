"""One-shot regression + metrics for the optimization grind.

Rebuilds the engine, runs all correctness checks, compares ground-truth
verify positions and per-position frame cycles against a recorded baseline,
prints a compact PASS/FAIL summary. Exit 0 iff all green.

    python3 run_regression.py                # gate against baseline.json
    python3 run_regression.py --rebaseline   # accept current cycles/verify
                                             # numbers as the new baseline

The baseline (baseline.json) holds per-position frame cycles and the
two-sided verify metrics at the ground-truth positions. Gates:
  - correctness scripts must pass (as before)
  - verify: over/miss displacement must not exceed the recorded values
    (positions recorded CLEAN must stay CLEAN)
  - cycles: suite total must not regress more than CYCLE_TOL vs baseline
Improvements are reported and accepted silently; run --rebaseline after a
deliberate optimisation to tighten the gate.
