; VXCACHE — the per-vertex RECIP + SCREEN-X cache (the "R" is the recip r,
; not "rotation": the ROTATION is what VRCACHE holds).  Skips redundant
; projection when several segs share a vertex.
; Fields: rhi, rlo, sx_lo, sx_hi (s16 projected screen X), near-clip
; flag — one plane each (see below). EV16 (2026-08-09): the s8 evy/evx
; planes DIED — near verdicts serve from CLIP, and the crossing
; recovers full s24 view totals via cr_recover instead of reading the
; lossy s8 tier.
; Valid bitmap: 1 bit per vertex; cleared at the start of each frame.
; VXCACHE is page-split SoA (2026-07-15): one 512-byte plane per field,
; junior page = idx 0-255, senior page = idx 256+ (n_verts <= 512,
; pack-time assert). The senior bit is header key byte B & $20 — the
; reader dispatches to an arm with the page BAKED, so there is no
; address generation anywhere in the vertex frame cache.
; BANKED: the four planes live in the BANK A window since 2026-08-17 — the
; audit censused ~20,000 accesses (VRCACHE off, VRCACHE on with the coherence walk, and
; the real driver from a bare machine) and every one already ran with bank 4
; paged, so this costs no paging and no cycles: abs,X in the window is the same
; 4 cycles it was in main. FLAT keeps them in main, so $0800-$0FFF and

; bit-identical copy in clip/arith.s was discarded; this one is exported and
; every caller — bsp transform code AND the bank-C clipper — JSRs here).
; It lives in main RAM (always mapped), so it is reachable from any bank
; phase: the data-bank transform arcs and the bank-C clipper alike. The sqr
; tables sit at SQR_BASE ($1C00 banked) for the same reason.
;
; ============================================================================
; umul8 — u8 × u8 → u16 via quarter-square tables. ~50 cycles, no loop.
;   Inputs:  A = a, zp_mul_b = b.
;   Output:  zp_prod_l/hi = a * b (u16).
;   Clobbers: A, X, Y.
;   CONTRACT (2026-07-09, carried from the clip copy): A = zp_prod_h on
;   return AND the N/Z flags reflect it — BOTH exit paths end
;   `STA zp_prod_h`. Callers may take the product's HIGH byte straight
;   from A (backface's u24 magnitude products do). Preserve this if you
;   ever restructure the tail. zp_prod_l/hi alias zp_div_l/hi, so the
;   product feeds directly into udiv16_8 with no extra loads.
;
;   Identity: a*b = qsqr(a+b) - qsqr(|a-b|), where qsqr(n) = floor(n²/4).
;   Pseudocode:
;     d = |a - b|                       # Y index
;     s = a + b                         # X index (9 bits)
;     if s < 256:  prod = sqr[s]  - sqr[d]
;     else:        prod = sqr2[s & $FF] - sqr[d]   # sqr2[n] = qsqr(n+256)
;   The sqr2 tables absorb the 9th bit of a+b, so no 16-bit indexing is
;   needed. (The uo path enters SBC with carry set from the ADC overflow,
;   which is exactly the required borrow-clear.)
