;   2  NEAR CLIP   0 clipped: continue; 1: reproject at crossing; 2: cull

; STAGE 1 — TRANSFORM.  v1 goes through the chain probe first: if this
; seg's v1 is the vertex the previous transform produced (the packer
; chain-orders subsector segs, ~80% hit on consecutive front pairs),
; VX2 is copied wholesale into VX1 and the transform is skipped.
;
;   if hdr.v1_idx == last_idx:           # chain hit
;       VX1 <- VX2 (clip; and if unclipped: sx, recips)

;       last_idx = hdr.v1_idx; transform v1 into VX1
;   transform v2 into VX2 (always)
;
; The chain compare is ONE byte (2026-08-13): the packer guarantees no
; two vertices of a subsector share an id low byte, and the key is
; invalidated (lo := $FF, matched by no vertex) at subsector
; boundaries and crossings — so lo equality PROVES identity, and the
; hit arm recovers the B byte from the live key instead of the header.
; The lo byte is banked into zp_v1i_l as it is read — stage 7's v1
; probe needs the key after the v2 transform overwrites zp_seg_v_idx.
; The transform (br_seg_xform_vertex, seg_xform.s) is side-baked:
; sx_vert_lo / sx_vert_hi by bit 5 of the idx B byte (senior plane).
; It writes clip/sx/recip directly into the struct named by zp_seg_ep
; and exits in bank L2 on every path.
