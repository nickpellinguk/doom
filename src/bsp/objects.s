; objects.s — static object (billboard) draw.
;
; The map THINGS that never move and stand off the floor (solid
; decorations + barrels) are drawn as flat outline rectangles at the END
; of their home subsector's seg loop.  Drawing THERE is what buys
; occlusion for free: the BSP walk is front-to-back, so everything
; nearer has already marked its spans solid and the clipper hides
; whatever sits behind a wall — no sprite sort, no depth buffer.
;
; Per object: ONE rotation, ONE reciprocal, TWO project_x, TWO
; project_y, four clipped lines.  The billboard faces the viewer, so its
; left/right edges are simply vx -/+ r in VIEW space, and project_x is
; linear in vx — no second rotation, and both edges share the depth and
; therefore the reciprocal.  The position uses the vertex planes' own
; page-decomposed encoding, so staging an object IS staging a vertex and
; rot_w_pages is reused verbatim.
;
; Table: SoA planes at ROM_OBJ_C (layout.inc), sorted by home subsector,
; plus a per-subsector "has objects" bitmap so an ordinary subsector
; costs one bit test and nothing else.
;
; BANK CONTRACT: pages BANK_SEG itself (table, recips and the VYCACHE memo
; all live there), then BANK_C for the clipper.  Exits under BANK_C,
; exactly as an emit arc does.

; the walk has already closed every one of them.
;
; A billboard spans [cx-a, cx+a] — X[0]/X[5] are exactly those — so this
; needs only cx and the half width, which is why it sits at the TOP of
; obj_draw_slot: before the vertex build, the art walk and the tighten.
; C=0 means invisible: every line would be clipped away, and tightening
; columns that are already solid is a no-op, so the whole slot is skipped.
;
; Measured: 17 of 37 billboards stamped over the 19-pose suite are fully
; occluded, and they were burning 53,816 cycles drawing nothing.
;
; span_has_gap wants NATIVE [lo, hi): zp_i_l = lo, A = hi EXCLUSIVE. The
; +1 for the exclusive edge rides the SEC into the ADC. It preserves V
; and lives in main RAM, so this is a plain JSR from either build.
; A box wholly off screen is left to the clipper (rare, and the test
; would cost more bytes than it saves).

;
; Two conditions, both cheap and both once per billboard (not per line):
;   1. FULLY ON SCREEN. The box is [X0,X5] x [yt,yb]: X0/X5 are the
;      sorted extremes of the six x values and the lid top / base bottom
;      bound y, so the box contains every art vertex by construction
;      (verified over the suite: 0 violations). All four HI bytes must be
;      zero and y must sit inside the visible band.
;   2. FULLY UNCLIPPED. Walk the active span list (sorted by XSTART) and
;      require the spans to COVER [X0,X5] with no gap — a gap is a column
;      the walk already closed as solid — and each covering span's INNER
;      aperture [IT,IB] to contain [yt,yb]. IT/IB are the per-span
;      extremes, so that is exactly dcl's Tier-2 inner accept, hoisted
;      out of the per-line walk and asked once for the whole box.

; A LOW-LOD OCTAGON TIER IS DESIGNED BUT NOT LANDED (Eben 2026-09-05, "an

; The builder side is one line: select the MIDDLE magnitude by tier — a2 =
; 0.7321 (dodecagon, #187) or the cut-square octagon's c = 0.4142 (#106) —
; keep #69 for the neck, and on the far tier copy c into obj_pb+2 so the
; octagon template's unused a3 y-slots hold in-band duplicates instead of
; an earlier object's stale bytes (the crash below).  What blocks it is
; ART SPACE: the template is 12 segments + 2 control bytes = 50 B and the
; windows have 27 / 23 / 0 B free, with no room for a fourth (banked art
; is $9B00-$9DFF under VDESC $9E00, flat $F100-$F3FF under $F400, and
; $9900 is the driver sincos).  NOTE WHEN LANDING IT: obj_lodh $FF means
; the potion always takes tier 0, which is the FAR tier — so the fork must
; arrive WITH a real threshold and the far tpl entry, never before.
; SINGLE-TIER (2026-09-03): obj_lodh pins the potion at tier 0 and BOTH
; obj_tpl entries are POTL0, but this builder still forked on obj_lod --
; tier 0 built the RETIRED far ladder (y offs 0-8, old semantics) under
; the near template, leaving offs 10/12 STALE.  A stale off-12 y from an
; earlier object made a reversed out-of-band vertical, and vplot's
; armed-RTS ran off the unroll: the (585,-3437,244) crash.  The builder
; is now unconditionally the POTL0 (dodecagon) ladder; the far arm died.
