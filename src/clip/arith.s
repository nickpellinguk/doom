; segment; umul8 unified into bsp/header.s 2026-08-09 — main RAM, imported
; here — and the old $2030 first-code pin died with it), the

; Sibling cross-refs: pool.s (allocator + udiv16_8), interp.s (interp_store),

; (umul8 UNIFIED into bsp/header.s 2026-08-09: the bit-identical local
; copy there — main RAM, always mapped, reachable from the bank-C
; clipper — is now THE multiplier; this file's copy and its $2030
; first-code pin are gone. clip/header.s imports the symbol; callers
; are unchanged. udiv16_8 below is now the first code in the CLIP
; segment.)

; (udiv16_8 moved here from clip/pool.s 2026-08-09: the mul/div pair
; lives together — umul8's product aliases udiv16_8's dividend — and

; organization. Callers: dcl.s, interp.s, s16_interp below.)

; UDIV16_8: unsigned 16/8 restoring division
;
; Divides zp_div_l:hi by zp_div_den, quotient returned in A.
; FAST PATH (most common): div_hi < den => quot fits u8, 8 iterations.
; SLOW PATH: div_hi >= den (seg extrapolation), 16 iterations.
;
; Uses the INC-shift trick: as bits ASL out of div_lo, quotient bits
; accumulate via INC in the vacated positions.  After N iterations,
; div_lo == quotient.
;
; *** HOTTEST LOOP *** -- the 3-instruction shift chain (ASL/ROL/ROL)
; plus trial subtraction account for ~20% of all clipper cycles.
;
; Input:  zp_div_l:zp_div_h = dividend (u16; aliases zp_prod_l/hi so
;         umul8's product is already in place), zp_div_den = divisor
;         (u8, caller guarantees != 0).
; Output: A = quotient. Fast path: full u8 quotient. Slow path: LOW byte
;         of the 16-bit quotient (high byte is left in zp_div_h);
;         callers on that path only need the low 8 bits. Remainder is
;         discarded. Clobbers X and zp_div_l/hi; Y preserved.
;
; pseudocode:
;   if div_hi < den:                      # quotient fits u8
;       rem:acc = dividend (rem in A)     # 8 shift/trial-subtract steps,
;       skip leading 0 quotient bits cheaply, then main loop
;   else:                                 # rare: seg extrapolation
;       16 shift/trial-subtract steps, quotient spread over div_lo:div_hi
;   return div_lo

; 32-byte block, one byte per slot.  Slot N is at POOL_FIELD + N.
; X register holds the slot number directly (0-31).
; Slot 0 is the null sentinel; slot 1 is the initial active span;
; slots 2..31 start on the free list.

;   BL       bot y at BXLO
;   TR       top y at TXLO+TDEN
;   BR       bot y at BXLO+BDEN
;   XSTART   active range start (mutable: shrunk by mark_solid / tighten fragments)
;   XEND     active range end, EXCLUSIVE (mutable) — the span covers
;            columns [XSTART, XEND); a full-screen span has XEND=255
;            (column 255 is nonexistent by decree)
;   OT       min(TL, TR) — outer top (precomputed bbox)

; (POOL / POOL_* field equates MOVED to zp.inc 2026-08-29 so the BSP

; flags $B6", "tighten secondary seg params $B2-$B5" — all described
; the RETIRED per-span tighten (tg_go / mel / span_tighten; see the

; src/zp.inc any more, and $A0-$A7 belong to the bsp/ang modules today.
; src/zp.inc is the single source of truth for the live map.

; === Draw-clipped-line ZP ($A8-$B9) ===
; Caller sets zp_line_xl/yl/xr/yr ($A8-$AB); DCL computes dx/dy/ylo/yhi
; ($AC-$AF); seg_start $B0/$B1; CB-clip working set $B2-$B9 (overlaid

; any more (the harness pins it to 0).
; ===== DCL records hook ($BC-$BE) =====
; When zp_dcl_rec_buf_h ($BD) is non-zero, dcl_emit_segment appends ONE
; 4-byte record (xl, yl, xr, yr — biased Y) per SURVIVING segment to the
; buffer at (zp_dcl_rec_buf), bumping the count in byte 0;
; zp_dcl_rec_off ($BE) is the 1-based write offset. Callers arm with hi
; byte $07 (TOP_RECORDS) or $08 (BOT_RECORDS) and disarm with $00.
; br_init_frame grounds the pointer once per frame; every DCL call site
; arms/disarms explicitly.  (An older note here described the legacy
; 6-byte clip_line_records format and a $03/$01/$02 side mask — both
; retired; see the LEGACY note under TOP_RECORDS below.)

; === Line output buffer ($0200) ===
; (LINE_OUT capture RETIRED 2026-07-26: it was harness-only, and the
; engine paid a LINE_OUT_EN gate test on EVERY emitted line (41/frame
; measured) plus two per-call count-zeroings for it. The harness now
; PC-traps the plot entries (plot_h / plot_v / RASTER_ENTRY) and reads
; the staged RASTER_ZP_X0/Y0/X1/Y1 directly — same tuples, zero engine
; cost. Freed: $0200-$02xx scratch (which had OVERLAPPED the D-cache
; range $0210-$03F7 whenever a stray emit ran with EN garbage) and the
; $0BE8 flag byte.)

; === Tighten records buffers ($0700, $0800) ===
; clip_line_records writes per-span sub-records here; tighten_from_records
; consumes them. Each buffer: byte 0 = record count, then records (6
; bytes each) at offset +1. Top buffer for yt-line, bot buffer for yb-line.
;   Record format: si (slot index), sox0, sox1, verdict, cy0, cy1
;     verdict: 0 = above, 1 = inside, 2 = below
;     cy0, cy1 only meaningful for verdict=inside (line y at sox0, sox1)
; NOTE (2026-07): the 6-byte verdict record layout above is the LEGACY
; Phase-A format and is retained as a historical reference only.  The
; shipping records path uses 4-byte segment records (xl, yl, xr, yr) —
; one per surviving DCL segment — written by dcl_emit_segment (clip/dcl.s)
; and consumed by tighten_from_records (clip/tfr.s).  Byte 0 of each
; buffer is still the record COUNT; records start at offset 1.
; REC_BYTES/REC_VERDICT_* below are unreferenced (kept: equates emit no
; bytes and record the old scheme).
; (TOP_RECORDS/BOT_RECORDS moved to zp.inc 2026-08-09 — the arm sites
; in bsp/seg_emit.s used to HARDCODE #$07/$0700 because the equates
; were clip-unit-local; the silent-collision that bit the VRCACHE-planes
; move. One registry now.)
REC_BYTES = 6                           ; bytes per record

; === NJ rasteriser integration ===
; The NJ rasteriser is NOT part of this link — the flat build loads its
; binary at $A900 (see nj_raster.py for the pixel-exact reference).
; dcl.s's emit dispatch (des_dispatch / dv_emit) tail-calls it for
; diagonal segments; axis-aligned ones (~70% of pixels) go to the local
; plot_h / plot_v in clip/plot_axis.s instead.
; ZP $82-$85 = x0,y0,x1,y1 (rasteriser inputs, no conflict with clipper ZP).
; ZP $70 = screen start hi byte, set per frame by the caller (the walk
; driver stores the back-buffer page; the Python harness sets it in
; flat tests).

; Note: prod_lo aliases div_lo -- multiply output feeds directly into
; division input, saving two loads per interp call.
; s16 line endpoints for the s16 clipper enter through zp_line_*_lo/_hi

; it, so it lives with the arithmetic primitives — no back edge).

; s16_interp — find target axis at given free-axis value
; The "free" axis is the one whose value we know (the clip target);
; the "target" axis is the one we want to compute. Caller sets:
;   LC_TGT_LO/HI       = target free-axis value (s16)
;   LC_OX1_LO/HI etc.  = anchor 1 (free, target)
;   LC_OX2_LO/HI etc.  = anchor 2 (free, target)
; To clip x at boundary: free=x, target=y, OX*=x, OY*=y.
; To clip y at boundary: free=y, target=x, OX*=y, OY*=x.
; Output: A = clamped u8 result, LC_RES_LO/HI = unclamped s16 result.
; Clobbers: many.
;
; Python mirror: _interp_store_s16 (endpoint_spans.py).  Computes with
; |offset|, |den|, |dy| and a +den//2 bias before the divide, then
; adds/subtracts the quotient — i.e. rounds half AWAY FROM ZERO (see
; the mirror's docstring for the 1px descending-line bug this fixed).
; Pseudocode:
;   off = tgt - x0; den = x1 - x0
;   if den < 0: off, den = -off, -den
;   if den == 0 or off == 0: return y0     # degenerate / at anchor 1
;   if off == den: return y1               # at anchor 2
;   dy = y1 - y0; if dy == 0: return y0    # horizontal
;   q = (|off| * |dy| + den//2) // den     # u8 fast path: umul8 +
;                                          # udiv16_8; else 16x16/32:16
;   res = y0 + q if dy > 0 else y0 - q
;   A = clamp(res, 0, 255); LC_RES = res
; NOTE: no directed rounding here — callers that need floor/ceil
; behaviour (dcl_boundary_ix) do their own arithmetic.
