; DRAW_CLIPPED_LINE: clip a single line against the span list and plot
; the visible portions (plot_h / plot_v / NJ rasteriser).
;
; Reached natively THROUGH dcl_s16.s (draw_clipped_line_s16[_h] falls
; through / jumps here once coords are u8); the direct u8 entry
; draw_clipped_line is used by the Python harness (by symbol
; on the bsp side).  Banked build: bank C must already be paged.
;
; Phase 1: basic walk with outer bbox reject / inner bbox accept.
; No CB clip (ambiguous cases skipped), no portal continuation
; (each span is considered independently).
;
; Inputs (ZP): zp_line_xl_l, zp_line_yl_l, zp_line_xr_l, zp_line_yr_l
; The line MUST be oriented left-to-right (xl <= xr).
; All Y values u8, biased by Y_BIAS (visible rows [0,159] -> [48,207]).

;
; Output: each surviving segment is staged into RASTER_ZP_X0..Y1 (Y
; un-biased) and dispatched to plot_h / plot_v / RASTER_ENTRY as it is
; produced.  RUN-OUT at the ranges->pixels boundary (Eben's ruling):
; X1 is staged as the segment's EXCLUSIVE end column and the raster
; paints through it inclusively — no -1 anywhere.  In records mode,
; one 4-byte record (xl,yl,xr,yr — BIASED Y, claiming columns
; [xl, xr)) per surviving segment is appended to the record buffer
; (count in byte 0) for the records-driven tighten (consumer:
; tighten_from_records, clip/tfr.s).  (The old LINE_OUT capture was
; RETIRED 2026-07-26 — the harness PC-traps the plot entries.)

; was right at the time: dcl_entry_path recomputed the bbox before every
; Tier read, so computing it here as well was dead work.  Two things
; changed since.  The deferred-emit restructure made EVERY span run the
; entry path (1.29 times per call, measured), and the portal check's
; death removed both narrowers — the CB no-exit-clip narrowing and the
; portal commit — so nothing writes ylo/yhi mid-walk any more.  yl and yr
; are provably unchanged across a call (asserted by probe: 0 of 411
; entries saw them differ), so the bbox is loop-invariant and belongs
; here.
;
; BELOW the vertical branch on purpose: dcl_vert_on is an EXPORTED entry
; that seg_emit jumps to per vertical descriptor, bypassing this routine
; entirely, and it CLAMPS yl/yr into the u8 band before use — so the
; vertical handler must keep computing its own bbox, after that clamp.

; over a contiguous visible run, or clipped; breaking one contiguous run
; into two emitted fragments draws a DIFFERENT line, because each
; fragment is rasterised from its OWN endpoints (measured: splitting at
; an interior column changes the raster 40% of the time).
;
; The old design decided at span N whether to merge into span N+1, using
; a CONSERVATIVE containment test against the next span's inner bbox.
; When that test could not prove containment it ENDED the segment at the
; shared boundary and let span N+1 re-open one at the very same column —
; a split-and-continue, i.e. exactly the forbidden thing, on 4.4% of
; drawn lines (11.5% at 845,-3084,215).
;
; Now the segment is simply left OPEN and its emit DEFERRED.  Each span
; is clipped on its own merits, and the open segment is closed only when
; the line is PROVEN to leave the chain: it exits the aperture, or the
; next visible run does not start where the last one ended (a solid gap
; between spans), or the list/line ends.  A conservative test can then
; only cost cycles, never pixels.  zp_seg_end_x carries the right end of

;  It existed to decide, at span N, whether the line could be merged
;  across the portal into span N+1 without re-clipping, by testing the

;  test is conservative, and its failure path ended the segment at the

;
;  Walking on with the segment open and clipping span N+1 on its own

;  the containment test cost a compare chain plus, when the boundary was

;  falls straight through to "extend".)

; (serves xl even from a span whose EXCLUSIVE end == xl), so boundary
; columns are always served by the LEFTMOST touching span — a stale
; aperture at every portal's x_lo jamb.  The designed fix (serve from
; the more restrictive touching span; prototype in tools/joint_proto
; .py) awaits its rebaseline — do not 'tidy' the compares to strict
; without landing that fix.
;
; Inputs:  zp_line_xl_l (== xr), zp_line_yl_l, zp_line_yr_l; zp_head.
; Output:  at most one segment staged to RASTER_ZP_* + plot_v; no

; ========== Phase 4: CB clip (clip_to_span) ==========
; Exact clip of the line against the span's trapezoid aperture.
; Entry: X = span pointer, seg_start_x == $FF (no active segment)
; Uses interp_store to evaluate span boundaries at clipped endpoints.
;
; Python mirror: _clip_to_span (endpoint_spans.py), restricted to the
; already-computed overlap [ox0, ox1] (the X clip is just cx1=ox0,
; cx2=ox1 since the walk guarantees overlap).
;
; Inputs:  zp_ox0/zp_ox1 (overlap), zp_line_* (line), X = span slot.
; Outputs: either
;   - reject (line outside aperture): advance to next span, or
;   - exit clipped inside the span (cx2 < ox1): emit fragment
;     (cx1,cy1)-(cx2,cy2) immediately, reset seg_start, next span, or
;   - exit not clipped (cx2 == ox1): seg_start = (cx1,cy1), narrow the
;     running Y bbox to [min(cy1,cy2), max(cy1,cy2)], resume at the
;     normal exit check (portal merge still possible).
; Clobbers: zp_cb_* workspace, interp workspace, zp_tmp0/1, zp_save0/1.
;
; Pseudocode:
;   cx1, cx2 = ox0, ox1
;   cy1 = line_y_at(cx1); cy2 = line_y_at(cx2)       # round-to-nearest
;   # top boundary: need cy >= top at both ends

;       top1 = span_top(cx1); top2 = span_top(cx2)
;       if cy1 < top1 and cy2 < top2: reject          # both above

; 64 x 4-byte post-clip segments at PLOTQ ($1000).  While plotq_mode is
; $80 (driver arms it at flip), plots append here instead of drawing —
; the back buffer is still on display until the flip's vsync.  Each
; append then calls the pq_pump vector: the DRIVER's pump polls the
; vsync latch and, once it fires (or the queue fills), full-clears the
; new back buffer, drains the queue and drops plotq_mode to direct.
; Harness/default: plotq_mode = 0 — everything draws direct and the
; only cost is the 6-cycle gate per line.  FIFO drain preserves
; production order; the plotter is re-derived from the coords exactly
; as des_dispatch would (y0==y1 -> plot_h, x0==x1 -> plot_v with the
; des_to_v normalize, else NJ) — pixels identical by construction.
; ============================================================================

; ($1100-$11FF is FREE in BOTH builds since 2026-08-17: it held the driver's
;  per-frame beam-phase cadence ring, retired with the $0A50 frame counter
;  that indexed it — $0A50 is VC_RLO+$50, so that INC was corrupting one
;  cached vertex rotation per frame. Neighbours: PLOTQ below, VRCACHE_XLO above.)
; ============================================================================
; plotq_arm / plotq_off — retarget the dv_emit dispatch (dv_emit_op) and
; set the mode. The mode flips twice a frame; the site runs hundreds of
; times, so the cost belongs here.
;
; plotq_off MUST run before plotq_drain: the drain dispatches through the
; same emit cascade, so a still-armed dv_emit_op would re-enqueue lines
; instead of drawing them.

; --- line_interp_store: compute line Y at column A ---
; Reads directly from zp_line_xl_l/yl/yr/dx — no shuffle into the
; interp workspace needed.  Defers div_den setup past offset-zero
; and offset-max shortcuts.
; Input: A = x column.  Output: A = line Y.
; Clobbers: Y, mul_b, prod_*, div_*.
;
; Python mirror: _interp_store (endpoint_spans.py) with anchors
; (xl,yl)-(xr,yr): direction-split unsigned round-to-nearest —
;   off = x - xl
;   if yr >= yl: return yl + (off*(yr-yl) + dx//2) // dx
;   else:        return yl - (off*(yl-yr) + dx//2) // dx
; The multiply-round-divide is umul_round_div (umul8 + den/2 bias +

; RECORDS-DRIVEN TIGHTEN — architecture note (rewritten 2026-07-12)
;
; Shipping path: dcl_emit_segment (above) writes ONE 4-byte record
; (xl, yl, xr, yr) per surviving DCL segment into TOP_RECORDS /
; BOT_RECORDS — routed by zp_dcl_rec_buf (hi byte $07/$08, $00 = off) —
; while the caller draws the portal's yt / yb edge lines;
; tighten_from_records (clip/tfr.s, included next) consumes the two
; buffers and applies the narrowing.  This replaced the old
; draw_clipped + per-span tighten pair for portal segs.
;
; A separate clip_line_records ROUTINE (the Phase-A 6-byte verdict
; records described in older notes) no longer exists in the 6502; the
; name survives only in the Python reference
; (endpoint_spans.clip_line_records), which remains the behavioural
; mirror for what the records must capture.
; ======================================================================
; (End of file — no code below.  The tighten consumer and its TFS_*
; state block are in clip/tfr.s.)


; ============================================================================
; Verdict-record support (2026-07-13 off-screen-aperture fix). In MAIN:
; the CLIP region is at its ceiling; main RAM is always mapped so the
; bank-C clipper JSRs here freely. Absolutes DCLV_* live in tfr.s's block.
; ============================================================================
SEG_HIGH
; dcl_rec_flat — append a FLAT VERDICT record (A = y: 0 'above',
; $FF 'below') over [DCLV_X0, DCLV_X1] to the active record buffer.
; No-op when records mode is off or the range is empty. MERGES into the
; previous record when it is the same flat value and abuts/overlaps
; (double-reject arms can re-cover a range — the merge absorbs it).
; Capacity guard: a full buffer drops the append (never hit in corpus;
; the harness counts). Preserves X. Clobbers A, Y.
; (dcl_rec_flat moved to clip/fusedw.s 2026-08-25 — it IS the fused
;  flat handler now, and the DAG wants no dcl -> fused edge)

; wrappers staging the range, so CLIP call sites stay 5 bytes
; (dcl_rec_flat_span / _left / dcl_rec_right died 2026-08-25 —
;  the u8 core has no record consumers left)

; ============================================================================
; adyn_ctr — emitted-segment counter for the walk's dynamic always-descend

; fragment; src/bsp/walk.s samples it either side of a far descent to
; decide whether that subtree earned its speculation.  Main RAM (RWC), so
; it is writable in both builds and readable with any bank paged in.
