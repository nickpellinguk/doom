; clip/fbclear.s — clipper fragment 13 of 13, last in the link (module
; map: clip/header.s). Framebuffer clears — bank C (Eben's call, 2026-08-16).
;
; These were three unrolled routines in walk_drv.asm at DRV_CLR ($2200),
; ~145 B of the driver's 1,229. Moving them here buys that back in main
; RAM, which is the scarce resource (304 B free across the whole 32K),
; and costs one ROMSEL write per call — nothing against a 5,120-byte
; clear. Bank C is the right home: it ships in per-CPU variants already
; (BANK1/BANK1C), so unlike L0/L2 there is no CPU-invariance constraint
; on what lives here, and both driver call sites page bank C for the
; plot-queue drain IMMEDIATELY afterwards, so the paging is free in
; practice.
;
; BANKED ONLY. The flat build is the py65 harness: its framebuffer is a
; single buffer at $EA00 and no driver runs, so there is nothing here to
; call and DV_BACKHI has no flat address at all.
;
; Each buffer is 20 pages. One INY/BNE loop with 20 unrolled STA abs,Y
; is 5 cycles/byte -- 25,600 cycles for a full buffer.
;
; NOTE (2026-08-16): the driver's comment here described a four-way
; split (clr58t/clr58b/clr6Ct/clr6Cb) into 10-page halves, "so
; flip_sched can clear the beam-passed top early while waiting for
; vsync to release the bottom". No such split ever existed in the code;
; the plot run-ahead queue (fb71e3a) solved that problem a different
; way. The comment is not carried over.
