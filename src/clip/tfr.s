; clip/tfr.s — clipper fragment 8 of 13 (module map: clip/header.s).
; Contents: tg_append_x (list builder + merge — fused_merge_range's
; value test), the DCLV_*/LC_* absolute working sets for the s16
; clipper (code in clip/dcl_s16.s), and seg_zero_rec_solid (exported
; to bsp/subsector.s). The records sweep died 2026-08-25 (clip/fused.s).
; ============================================================================

; (TG_APPEND_X died 2026-08-25 with the sweep — its only callers. Its
;  merge condition survives as fused_merge_range's 8-field value test,
;  which enforces the same no-value-equal-abutting-pair postcondition.)

; (FLUSH_PEND macro died with the sweep, 2026-08-25)

SEG_BANKC
; TFS state block — the 3-cursor event walk's working set.
; (Moved here from the deleted 6-byte-records legacy file.)
; ZP SWEEP (2026-08-11, profiled): the HOT members moved to the zp
; bytes freed by the TRUE16/TRIG5 arcs (heat-ranked py65 profile,
; ~1k cyc/frame in this block alone); the cold tail stays in the
; $06xx scratch page. Every promoted byte is logged in src/zp.inc —
; the free-list is the trap (the $CB/zp_tail_vec near-miss). The
; PROMOTED equates live in src/zp.inc (must be seen before all code
; or ca65 sizes the operands absolute — codescan caught exactly that).
; PEND_* is a 1-deep output buffer: the interval most recently produced
; by the sweep, held back so the next interval can extend it in place
; (same top/bot sources) instead of allocating a new pool span.
; SOURCE-ANCHORED BOUNDARIES (2026-08-22). Each side is carried as its
; SOURCE line's own (anchor_lo, den, y_lo, y_hi) rather than the two
; values interpolated onto the interval's ends, so a pure side costs
; four copies instead of two interp_store calls. The MIXED arms (max/
; min of pool and record) cannot be one line, so they still interpolate
; onto [cur_x, next_x] and anchor there.
; ALL 28 PROMOTED TO ZERO PAGE 2026-08-22 — the equates are in
; src/zp.inc (they MUST be seen before any code or ca65 sizes the
; operands absolute; codescan gates exactly that).  Measured 2,379
; accesses to this block on the heavy frame, so the promotion is
; worth ~2,379 cycles and one byte per instruction.
; --- verdict-record support (2026-07-13 off-screen-aperture fix) ---

; consumption points, 2026-07-13)

; Priced with tools/zpheat.py on the heavy frame: a ZP byte's only honest
; cost is how often it is touched (1 cycle and 1 byte per access to move
; it out).  These are the clipper's coldest ZP residents and all three are
; plain scalars — no (zp),Y, no zp,X — so the move is an address change:
;   zp_cb_top2  18 accesses/frame     zp_cb_bot2  16
;   zp_save1     8
; 42 cycles a frame buys three of the 28 bytes the TFS sweep state needs.

;  emit_unchanged_subspan DIED with the FUSED cutover 2026-08-25 —

;  tg_append_x survives above (fused_merge_range's test is its test);

; ---- s16 line input (wrapper writes these) ----
; Lo bytes alias zp_line_* (the same u8 slots DCL reads). Hi bytes
; alias the CB-clip / tighten-secondary ZP block ($B2-$B5) — those
; slots are used DOWNSTREAM of the s16 clipper (DCL clobbers them
; during emission), but the wrapper rewrites them before each call,
; so there's no conflict. ZP access shaves ~7 cycles off the in-range
; fast-path detect (4 ORAs of zp vs absolute).
; (LC_*_LO alias layer removed 2026-07-10: the s16 clipper reads the
; zp_line_* slots by their real names.)

SEG_HIGH
; (Relocated to the LO segment 2026-07-13: cold classifier, and the CLIP region is
; at its ceiling — main RAM is always mapped, so bank-C callers are fine.
; Slated for deletion by Part 2 of the aperture fix.)
; seg_zero_rec_solid — classify a portal whose aperture-edge DCL emissions
; produced ZERO records. That is ambiguous: either the opening covers the
; whole screen (the tighten is a genuine no-op -> skip), or the opening is
; entirely OFF-screen (every visible row in the seg's columns shows wall or
; flat -> the columns must be CLOSED). The packed-Python reference
; (endpoint_spans records verdicts: top 'below' or bot 'above' -> solid)
; already closes; the 6502 skipped, leaving the columns open — found via
; the (-486,-3307,243) phantom, where a screen-wide portal whose aperture
; projects wholly above the screen left columns 0..69 open and the far
; rooms drew through the wall (276px cross-impl divergence).
;
; In:  the packed ZP vertex structs (zp.inc VX1/VX2) biased s16 sy pairs,
;      zp_seg_flags (SF_NEEDBT=$04, SF_NEEDBB=$08).
; Out: C=1 -> aperture band provably empty on screen (caller appends a
;      SOLID over [ilo, ihi)); C=0 -> genuine no-op (skip).
; Caller: bsp/subsector.s seg-emit tail (direct .import, not a jt slot;
; bank C paged in the banked build). Clobbers A,X.
;
; Band bottom = min(fb, bb when SF_NEEDBB); band top = max(ft, bt when
; SF_NEEDBT). Empty on screen iff bottom < Y_BIAS at BOTH endpoints
; (min < k <=> either < k), or top > Y_BIAS+159 at both.
