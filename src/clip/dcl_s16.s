; clip/dcl_s16.s — clipper fragment 10 of 13 (module map:
; clip/header.s). Contents: the s16 pre-clip entries
; draw_clipped_line_s16 / draw_clipped_line_s16_h, which clip to the u8 box and dispatch into
; draw_clipped_line (clip/dcl.s). LC_* working-set addresses are
; declared in clip/tfr.s. (s16_interp and the inlined wide-arithmetic
; notes moved to clip/arith.s 2026-08-09 — dcl.s calls it too, and the
; call-graph file DAG wants no dcl -> dcl_s16 back edge.)

; draw_clipped_line_s16 — clip s16 line to u8 then dispatch to DCL.
; Reads zp_line_xl_l..zp_line_yr_h (8 bytes of s16 input).
; Writes u8 to zp_line_xl_l, zp_line_yl_l, zp_line_xr_l, zp_line_yr_l and
; falls through to draw_clipped_line. If line fully off-screen,
; degenerate, or otherwise rejected, RTS without invoking DCL.
;
; Python mirror: the wrapper side of span_clip_6502.draw_clipped_line
; plus _clip_to_screen semantics.  The CALLER has already ordered the
; endpoints left-to-right (x1 <= x2), rejected zero-length input, and
; written the LO bytes — which alias zp_line_xl_l/yl/xr/yr — so the
; all-in-u8 fast path is a single 4-byte OR test and a JMP.
;
; Pseudocode (slow path):
;   if HI(x1)|HI(y1)|HI(x2)|HI(y2) == 0: goto draw_clipped_line
;   if both x < 0 or both x > 255: reject     # same-side quick reject
;   if both y < 0 or both y > 255: reject
;   if either x out of [0,255]:               # X clip (per endpoint)
;       y_at = s16_interp(x = 0 or 255)       # UNCLAMPED s16 result —
;       (x, y) = (edge, y_at)                 # y may still be out of
;                                             # range for the y-clip
;   if both y < 0 or both y > 255: reject     # re-check after x-clip
;   if either y out of [0,255]:               # Y clip, axes swapped
;       x_at = s16_interp(y = 0 or 255)       # (clamped u8 is fine:
;       (x, y) = (x_at, edge)                 #  x already in [0,255])
;   if xl > xr: swap endpoints                # clip can reorder (rare)

;     names the line: +5 top, +7 bot, +9 btop, +11 bbot; lo at VX+X,
;     hi at VX+X+1). The x pair comes straight from zp_seg_sx1/sx2.
; THE SEG LAYER OWNS THE LEFT-TO-RIGHT CONTRACT: the seg loop
