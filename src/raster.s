; raster.s — the NJ line rasteriser, IN THE ENGINE LINK.
;
; It used to be its own ca65/ld65 unit (src/boot/linedraw_or.s +
; cfg/linedraw_or_banked.cfg -> linedraw_or_reloc.bin), which banked_bsp.py
; then spliced into the bank C image at a hardcoded offset.  Three things
; were wrong with that and all three die here:
;
;   * the blob named its thirteen zero-page bytes as LITERALS while the
;     engine let ld65 allocate RASTER_ZP_*.  They agreed by luck.  In-link
;     the equates sit next to the reservations they mirror and the assert
;     below is a build error rather than a wrong picture.
;   * RASTER_ENTRY was an abi.inc CONSTANT that had to be kept equal to
;     wherever Python happened to splice the bytes.  The linker owns the
;     address now and the assert pins the constant to it.
;   * the $A200-$ADFF budget was a Python `assert len(rast) <= ...`.  It is
;     a cfg region, so ld65 refuses an overrun at link time.
;
; BANKED ONLY.  The flat image has no rasteriser -- its RASTER_ENTRY is a
; 3-byte stub the tube builder patches to the resident emitters -- so the
; segment is empty there and the cfg marks it optional.
