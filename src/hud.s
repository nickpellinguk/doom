; Debug HUD — position and rotation on the top character row of the display.
;
; Renders "X=hhhh.hh Y=hhhh.hh R=hh F=hh" (map-relative prescaled
; position, s16 integer + 8-bit fraction of the driver's 8.8 fixed point,
; the view angle byte, and the PAL fields the last frame took) into the
; BACK buffer's first character row, after the
; frame render and before the flip, using the OS ROM font.  The fraction
; matters for exact position capture: the engine consumes the full 8.8,
; so an integer-only reading is up to 1 prescaled unit (8 world units)
; away from the true viewpoint.
; (The trailing " C" cache-class letter died 2026-09-04 with the extent
;  cache -- one class left, nothing to report.)
;
; Mode 4 makes this cheap: a character cell on row 0 is 8 CONSECUTIVE
; bytes at FB + col*8, and an OS glyph is 8 consecutive bytes at
; FONT + (ascii-32)*8 (the full 32..127 set is contiguous) — so a
; character is a straight 8-byte copy, background included (glyph zero
; bits overwrite any rendered line underneath, keeping the text legible).
;
; The font base is NOT fixed: OS 1.2 keeps it at $C000, MOS 3.20 at
; $F900. Hardwiring $C000 blitted MOS code on a Master, which is how the
; HUD came out as garbage there. SEARCHING for it was the next fix and
; was worse: 105 bytes took this segment past $A500 into VDESC and
; pressing H crashed the Model B. The driver now asks the OS which
; machine it is (OSBYTE 129) at entry, while the OS is still alive, and
; leaves the answer in DV_HUD_FONT. Note $F900 is not glyph-aligned the
; way $C000 is, so hud_char's offset add carries — see there.
;
;   for i, ch in enumerate(template):   # "X=....%.. Y=....%.. R=.. F=.. C"
;       if ch is a hex slot: ch = hexdigit(nibble of the referenced value)
;       dst = back_fb + i*8                  # back_fb page from the driver
;       dst[0..7] = os_font[(ch-32)*8 .. +7]
;
; Driver interface (walk_drv.asm): BOTH sides now derive the variable
; addresses from the abi.inc DV_* equates — private
; address copies are banned here because of the bug this caused: when
; the driver vars moved (2026-07-10) this file's stale hardcoded $3D8x
; copies survived, HUD_BACKHI read an engine-code byte as the FB page,
; and every glyph blit sprayed 192 bytes over a random page — ZP when
; it landed on page 0, corrupting the VZ easing state.  The block's
; layout is documented once, in tools/gen_abi.py, and the base has moved
; twice since (it is NOT $2080/$3D8x any more), which is exactly why no
; address is written down here.  The driver's hud_glue pages BANK_C and
; JSRs hud_draw ($A400) when DV_HUD_EN is nonzero.
;
; Banked-build only: the code lives in the bank C window (HUD region,
; $A400) and reads the OS ROM directly — the flat py65 harness has no OS,
; so the flat build emits nothing (test seeds a fake font instead). The
; region is sized to STOP at $A500, where banked_bsp seeds VDESC, so an
; overgrown HUD is a link error rather than a crash on hardware.
